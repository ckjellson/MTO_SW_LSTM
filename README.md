# Many-to-one sliding window LSTM in Pytorch

* Many-to-one LSTM using sliding window for arbitrary and varying sequence lengths.
* Uses zero-padding to get an equal number of windows fitted to the sequence lengths using the chosen stride.
* Can easily be adapted for classification/regression problems.
